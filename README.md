Starting working on APIv1.05. This version will be one of the final ones released as all features will be included (except encryption). We are adding the ability to add friends / accept a friend request / and remove friend (puts them back in pending status for now, will improve in APIv1.06). This is an exciting step in completing the API and filling in the gaps.
