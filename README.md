# News and Announcements

Starting working on APIv1.10. This version will be one of the final ones released as all features will be included (except encryption). We are adding the ability to add friends / accept a friend request / and remove friend (puts them back in pending status for now, will improve in APIv1.11). This is an exciting step in completing the API and filling in the gaps.

February 15, 2016 - Hey guys! Just released APIv1.10 and am currently pushing the new application (Redesigned from the ground up -- literally) and is so much better. Will begin to work on APIv1.11 soon, but my focus will be the application.

March 19, 2016 - Started looking into push notifications and this is something that would be so easy to impliment. So hopefully with APIv1.11 they will be implimented. Also I am not working on the project anymore UNLESS 1 person (that's right, one person) uses it. I looked at the registration and login logs and it is literally just me using it for testing. Anyways, if you want to contact me or something e-mail is: crobinson@inzernettechnologies.com
